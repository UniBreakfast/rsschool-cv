### summary:

I wish to express my interest in the Junior JavaScript Developer position within your company. I believe my skills and credentials are well suited to the requirements you are looking for. Despite the fact that I have no degree in Computer Science (never graduated from the University) I have solid background and knowledge in different areas of IT. I studied a range of courses and popular books, created a few of my own projects (you can check them on [GitHub](https://github.com/UniBreakfast)). 

In order to deepen my knowledge and skills in web development I started remote tutoring for beginners. Through this process I obtained better understanding of fundamentals and some of advanced software programming concepts. Also, I am a quick learner and I have a great passion for new technologies.

### code examples:
```js
const makeRepeatable =(fn, inter)=> {
  const start =()=> {
    stop(), fn()
    start.intId = setInterval(fn, inter)
  }
  const stop =()=> clearInterval(start.intId)
  return [start, stop]
}

const makeThrottled =(fn, delay)=> {
  const throttle =(...args)=> {
    clearTimeout(cancel.timer)
    cancel.timer = setTimeout(fn, delay, ...args)
  }
  const runNow =(...args)=> {
    clearTimeout(cancel.timer), fn(...args)
  }
  const cancel =()=> clearTimeout(cancel.timer)
  return [throttle, cancel, runNow]
}

// do note: I easily change my code style adapting to the people I teach or work with.
