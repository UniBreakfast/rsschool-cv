### Summary:

I wish to express my interest in the JavaScript Developer/Educator position within your company. I hope my skills and credentials are sufficient. Although I do not have a degree in Computer Science (I never graduated from university), I have a solid background and knowledge in various areas of IT. I have studied a wide range of courses and popular books, and created several of my own projects (you can check them on [GitHub](https://github.com/UniBreakfast)). 

To deepen my knowledge and skills as a web developer, I started remote tutoring for beginners. Through this process, I obtained a better understanding of fundamentals and also learned some advanced software programming concepts. However, my greatest passion is educating newcomers.

### Code Examples:
```js
const makeRepeatable = (fn, inter) => {
  const start = () => {
    stop(), fn()
    start.intId = setInterval(fn, inter)
  }
  const stop = () => clearInterval(start.intId)
  return [start, stop]
}

const makeThrottled = (fn, delay) => {
  const throttle = (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(cancel.timer)
    cancel.timer = setTimeout(fn, delay, ...args)
  }
  const runNow = (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(cancel.timer), fn(...args)
  }
  const cancel = () => clearTimeout(cancel.timer)
  return [throttle, cancel, runNow]
}

// do note: I easily change my code style adapting to the people I teach or work with.
```

#### English level:
Somewhere around B1 or B2.
