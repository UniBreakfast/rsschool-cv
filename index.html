    <h3>summary:</h3>
    <p>I wish to express my interest in the Junior JavaScript Developer position within your company. I believe my skills and credentials are well suited to the requirements you are looking for. Despite the fact that I have no degree in Computer Science (never graduated from the University) I have solid background and knowledge in different areas of IT. I studied a range of courses and popular books, created a few of my own projects (you can check them on GitHub).</p>
    <p>In order to deepen my knowledge and skills as a web developer I started remote tutoring for beginners. Through this process I obtained even better understanding of fundamentals and also picked up some of advanced software programming concepts. I am a quick learner and I have a great passion for new technologies.</p>

    <h3>code examples:</h3>
    <pre>
      const makeRepeatable =(fn, inter)=> {
        const start =()=> {
          stop(), fn()
          start.intId = setInterval(fn, inter)
        }
        const stop =()=> clearInterval(start.intId)
        return [start, stop]
      }

      const makeThrottled =(fn, delay)=> {
        const throttle =(...args)=> {
          clearTimeout(cancel.timer)
          cancel.timer = setTimeout(fn, delay, ...args)
        }
        const runNow =(...args)=> {
          clearTimeout(cancel.timer), fn(...args)
        }
        const cancel =()=> clearTimeout(cancel.timer)
        return [throttle, cancel, runNow]
      }

      // do note: I easily change my code style
      // adapting to the people I teach or work with.
